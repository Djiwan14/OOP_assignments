Assignment 1 - Implement the bag type which contains integers. Represent the bag as a sequence of (element, 
frequency) pairs. Implement as methods: inserting an element, removing an element, returning 
the frequency of an element, returning the largest element in the bag (suggestion: store the 
largest element and update it when the bag changes), printing the bag.
Solution is implemented fully in C# using Bag concept.

Assignment 2 - Hobby animals need several things to preserve their exhilaration. Cathy has some hobby animals: 
fishes, birds, and dogs. Every animal has a name and their exhilaration level is between 0 and 100 
(0 means that the animals dies). 
If their keeper is in a good mood, she takes care of everything to cheer up her animals, and their 
exhilaration level increases: of the fishes by 1, of the birds by 2, and of the dogs by 3. 
On an ordinary day, Cathy takes care of only the dogs (their exhilaration level does not change), so 
the exhilaration level of the rest decreases: of the fishes by 3, of the birds by 1. 
On a bad day, every animal becomes a bit sadder and their exhilaration level decreases: of the 
fishes by 5, of the birds by 3, and of the dogs by 10. 
Cathy’s mood improves by one if the exhilaration level of every alive animal is at least 5.
Every data is stored in a text file. The first line contains the number of animals. Each of the following 
lines contain the data of one animal: one character for the type (F – Fish, B – Bird, D – Dog), name 
of the animal (one word), and the initial level of exhilaration. In the last line, the daily moods of 
Cathy are enumerated by a list of characters (g – good, o – ordinary, b – bad). The file is assumed to 
be correct. Name the animal of the lowest level of exhilaration which is still alive at the end of the 
simulation. If there are more, name all of them!
Solution is implememted fully in C# using inheritamce and polymorphism OOP concepts
